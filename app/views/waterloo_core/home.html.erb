        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>UWSSA's mission is to promote the Serbian culture to the University of
           Waterloo students, staff, faculty and members of the UW community at large.</p>
        <p>We will do this by providing many opportunities for social interaction between
           the university community and the club such as social events, guest speakers,
           activities and/or initatives.</p>
        <p>The most important is to allow students to create strong, long-lasting friendships
           with people of similar interests.</p>
